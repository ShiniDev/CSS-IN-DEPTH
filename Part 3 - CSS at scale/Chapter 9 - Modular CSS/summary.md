# Summary
- Break your CSS up into small, reusable modules.
- Never write styles that reach into another module and change its appearance.
- Use variant classes to provide multiple versions of the same module.
- Divide large constructs into smaller modules; build your pages by piecing
together a number of modules.
- Group all rules for a module together in your stylesheet.
- Use a naming convention such as double-hyphens and double-underscores to
make your modulesâ€™ structure easier to understand at a glance.
