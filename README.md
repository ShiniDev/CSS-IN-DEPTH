# CSS in Depth by Keith J. Grant
*A journey to improve my front-end skills, because I suck at it.*

## Afterthoughts
Finally! I've finally finished reading a book, I never would've thought that my
first finished book would be a book about CSS. I've learned a lot of new things
that I did not know before such as positioning, grids, responsive layouts, and
etc. I'm excited to apply this to new projects that I would come up. LET'S GO!!!
