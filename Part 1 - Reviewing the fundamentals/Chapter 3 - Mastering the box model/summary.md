# Summary
- Always use a universal border-box fix for predictable element sizing.
- Avoid explicitly setting the height of an element to avoid overflow issues.
- Use modern layout techniques like display: table or a flexbox to produce col-
umns of equal height or to vertically center content.
- If your margins behave oddly, take steps to prevent margins from collapsing.
- Consider using the lobotomized owl selector on your page to globally apply
margins between stacked elements.
