# Summary
- Use gradients and shadows to add the appearance of depth to the page.
- Even basic flat designs can benefit from some subtle shadows or gradients.
- Use gradients with explicit color stops to add stripes to an element.
- A subtle background gradient rather than a flat color provides a little more
complexity to the design.
- Use blend modes to colorize or texture an image.
